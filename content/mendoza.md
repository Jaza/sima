### Accomodation Option

My mother rents a small apartment, which is in a quiet place and nice neighbourhood.

It is located in the area known as "Sexta Sección". That is 10 blocks from San Martin Park and 15 blocks from downtown.

It is a self-contained apartment in the middle of my patio. My mother lives at the front and I live at the back. In the apartment, there is wi-fi. There is a kitchen, a bathroom with a shower and a very small bedroom with a kingsize bed. In the bedroom there is air conditioning, and heating in the apartment for the winter. There is a small swimming-pool and comfortable chairs and a hammock to relax. In the patio, there are many plants and grape vines. If you are interested, you can contact me. There is a strict Spanish only policy, and you would have to communicate (and probably have to answer a lot of questions in Spanish with my mother only.) Of course, if it is absolutely essential, I would stoop to speaking to you in English on a limited basis. :) I can send you some pictures.

### Activities in Mendoza

Congratulations! You've bought your ticket, packed your bag and made it to the beautiful city of Mendoza - but now you are faced with a bigger question: what to do, apart from studying Spanish?

Here are some suggestions for things to do in Mendoza.

10 top activies that you can't miss if you are in Mendoza:

1. Go to a winery (you choose, there are many!)
2. Have a barbeque = un asado completo
3. Try the ice-creams. They are delicous!
4. Go to the Andes mountains by the local bus.
5. Have a drink at Arisitides Villanueva Street.
6. [Have dinner at a unique place](https://www.facebook.com/los.chocos)
7. Go to thermal hot spring waters in Cacheuta, the hotel Spa or the public swimming-pools.
8. Try "mate" = the local drink, kind of tea. You need that the locals offer that to you.
9. Visit San Martin park.
10. Do some extreme activity like paragliding.

**Wine Tours in Vans**

Many options, ask me. These can range from 150 to 400 US dollars, depending on the level of luxury.

**Thermal Hot Springs**

Cacheuta ("catch-AY-oou-tah") is the name of [the nearby spas](https://termascacheuta.com/). For 800 pesos you can have a day at the [Hotel Termas](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1729221-d1227466-Reviews-Hotel_Spa_Termas_Cacheuta-Cacheuta_Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html) there which is great value for poshness, a buffet lunch and very posh facilities. That is if you take an Expresso Uspallata bus (not a tour) from the terminal for about 15 pesos. You should reserve for a place by telephone. Or you could just get out of the bus (be sure to tell the bus driver: "Hotel Termas") and see if they have space, and if they do not, you could walk for about 45 minutes further to the public springs which are also nice but which cost about 150 pesos for entry. There are restaurants near the public pools. Catch the 9 am bus at the latest if you are going to the hotel, and if you want to be sure, buy the tickets the day before.

The public pools (stay on the bus until the end of the line) is obviously the best budget option, and the best option if you just want to spend a few hours there.

Public Buses, schedules subject to change, buy tickets day before! Micro buses a Cacheuta ("Expreso Uspallata"). Mendoza - Cacheuta, todos Dias: 9:00, 10:30, 13:30, 17:30, 20:00, plus Sabados: 6:00, plus Domingos y Feriados: 7:00. Cacheuta - Mendoza, todos Dias: 10:30, 12:15, 15:45, 18:50, 21:20, plus Sabados: 7:10, plus Domingos y Feriados: 8:10.
