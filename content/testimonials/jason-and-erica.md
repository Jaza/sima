Ana Maria is an excellent Spanish professor. Because of her experience and professionalism, she does a superb job of combining a structured approach to learning with the flexibility needed to customize her lessons for the particular needs and interests of her students. What better way to experience Mendoza than through its language, and what better way to learn its language than a combination of course-work and immersion in the life of the city, enhanced by visits to Mendoza's wineries, parks and museums? Our time in Mendoza was too short, but Ana Maria helped us make the most of it.
