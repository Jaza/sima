Hi guys,

We are a couple travelling around South America at the moment, currently in Mendoza, Argentina.

We also wanted to add on to the many rave reviews of Ana María Troncoso and her Spanish in Mendoza Argentina (SIMA) school.

We have just done 2 weeks of classes with Ana at her gorgeous place in Mendoza. Well muchas gracias CSers, because we stumbled across cheese&crackers from the couchsurfing thread and we are so glad we took your advice and chose Ana as our Spanish teacher. The lessons were fun and informal (ie. we sat in her backyard drinking coffee and wine) whilst remaining professional. We were complete beginners and 2 weeks later have learned the basic foundations of the language - which is accredited by the way. Ana María is both a certified Spanish and English teacher, so although she tries to conduct the whole lesson in Español (which we learned a lot from), she is happy to help you out in English when you start to struggle :) We highly recommend her!

Also - Mendoza is such a nice place, a good choice to spend a bit of time in learning Español, climbing mountains and drinking wine of course :)
