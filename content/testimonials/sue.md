I learned a lot during my 2 weeks of lessons with Ana, who has a vast library of resources from which she draws on to give you specifically the kind of education you require out of the lessons. She is able to spot my weak points and tailor the lessons accordingly. I had lessons in her warm house in freezing June, and sometimes outdoors when there is sun! I also had the opportunity to talk to her family from time to time, go on outings, and cook together, adding to the exposure to the language as it is spoken in daily life. She is highly recommended as a Spanish teacher during your stay in Mendoza!
