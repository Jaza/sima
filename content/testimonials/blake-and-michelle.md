Ana's class was terrific. My girlfriend and I only knew a few Spanish words before taking her class, and by the end we felt comfortable navigating quite a broad range of practical situations in Spanish. Ana's teaching style is natural, clear, and fun. One of the best aspects of taking Ana's class was that her lesson's were always extremely useful, because she was always took great care to focus on subjects and scenarios that we were interested in learning about. I'd definitely recommend her classes to anyone who wishes to learn Spanish in a comfortable environment.
