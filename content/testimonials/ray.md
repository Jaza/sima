Recently, I completed a two-week Spanish course in Mendoza with Ana Maria Troncoso. I feel that Ana is an excellent professor, and that I learned as much as I possibly could in two weeks. We (my father and I) are complete beginners, and after two weeks we can comfortably navigate many common scenarios in our ongoing travels. Ana is very patient, precise, and professional. Classes take place indoors or in the garden. We also did some fun activities like cooking classes, touring the city, and attending exchange events with other language students in Mendoza. To be clear, she is not your tour guide, but she is able to help you get your feet wet. I believe it was the perfect balance. With Ana's help, I was able to succeed in Spanish more than I thought I ever could.
