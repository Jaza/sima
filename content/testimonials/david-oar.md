I took classes with Ani in late 2012. I had private lessons for 20 hours per week, for four weeks. We pretty much followed her ‘Spanish on the road’ programme, which entailed a mixture of theory at her house, as well as some lessons based around activities in Mendoza.

I began at a fairly basic level of Spanish, and I found that I improved rapidly over the month. Ani was able to tailor class to my level of ability, which I found particularly helpful. Through Ani I also met numerous other locals, and was able to join several social events. I would recommend Ani to anyone who is committed to improving their Spanish and learning about Argentine culture!

Todavía aprendo español. Quizás vuelva a Mendoza algún día!
