Just to add my two cents, I too decided to stay in Mendoza for pretty much the reasons mentioned above. I spent a week doing private lessons with Ana Maria Troncoso (who was mentioned above) and would strongly recommend taking classes with her to anyone passing through Mendoza, even a single class with her would be helpful. I think I learned more from her in 2 hours a day for a week than 6 weeks of 4 hour a day classes in Peru. I really enjoyed Mendoza for the aforementioned reasons, but would warn people it has some of the most dangerous drivers I've run across on any of my travels (odd since when they're not behind the wheel Mendocinos are some of the nicest people in Argentina which in itself is saying a lot :-)
