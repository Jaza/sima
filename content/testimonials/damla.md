Ana is a great teacher who accommodates her schedule due to necessities of her students. In my two weeks of studies in Mendoza, despite the amount of homework (tarea-will never forget this word!) I really enjoyed my classes that took place in her garden. We practised speaking a lot during the lectures and that gave me the confidence of speaking in Spanish wherever I go after Mendoza. Ana focuses on the needs of individual students so I believe within so short time I learned all I needed to use in my journey in South America. Our final lecture in Hotel Tower Suits with a brunch was excellent and I received my certificate there; such a nice memory to remember all throughout my life. I definitely recommend Ana for those who are willing to learn Spanish during their journeys in South America or even if you are not travelling but wanna learn Spanish quickly from a lovely profesora! If I get a chance to go to Mendoza again, I’d like to continue where we stop…Thanks very much for your teachings, patience and lovely approach Ana!
