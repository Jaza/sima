Ana recognized that we were learning because we love to travel, not to write an exam or work in Spanish. So our lessons were heavily focused on practical use, social chit-chat, restaurants, taxis, and shopping. But she also understood that we needed to study grammer to understand what we were hearing, and gave us the framework we needed. We were delighted.
