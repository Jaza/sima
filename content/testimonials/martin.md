Before I moved to from the U.S. to Argentina, I spoke no spanish. I thought I would be able to learn enough from practicing with friends or people that I encountered in daily life. What a mistake!

Since studying Spanish with Ana, my life in Mendoza has greatly improved. Daily interactions are no longer stressful. Now, I can communicate with words and not with my hands.

I highly recommend Ana as a Spanish teacher to anybody living in or traveling through Mendoza.

Suerte!
