I took Ana's Spanish Class in Mendoza for 20 hours a week for three weeks in the middle of my 6 month backpacking trip after realizing it would probably be a good idea to learn in Spanish in a country that speaks it. One week was with a group and the other two were private. After taking her classes, my Spanish has improved leaps and bounds. I went from speaking almost nothing (only a couple words) to being able to converse, read and understand most (~about 60%) situations. She really does drill everything into your head. Of course I am far from fluent but it has made my interactions during my travels a lot less stressful and more rewarding since I am able to interact with the locals.

If you are to travel in south america for a long time like me, I highly recommend her classes. I would have taken more but she was already booked for the next week. It's years of high school Spanish back at home in just a few weeks. For traveling, even a week will help you immensely!

Good Luck!
