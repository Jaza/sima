With no background in Spanish my fiance and I decided that if we were going to travel around South America for the next 3 months we'd need help.

We'd searched a few forums and had a debate between schools or private tuition and then we found Ani, which made up our minds.

I think if you are a little shy about trying to speak spanish then having a personal tutor is great, she will make you speak in spanish the whole time your with her, without ever putting you under too much pressure. We decided to do 30hrs including activities which was good as we may not have made it to these places other wise.

We both really enjoyed the cooking class and the wine tasting, and now confident in making Empanadas on our own. We would definitely recommend if you have time trying to prepare conversations before for activities and really practicing the stuff you have learnt already.

As for our spanish we believe we have made a good start and much better now in restaurants, shops and meeting new people and practicing our spanish with the locals. Its been great for making new friends i think they really appreciate the effort. I think its really going to enhance our experiences here, Thanks again Ani.

Buena suerte.
