My husband and I spent 4 weeks learning Spanish with Ana and I am so glad we did. Ana is a wonderful teacher and her rates are a great value. She tailors and prepares each lesson based on the student’s individual needs. Not only is she a great teacher, but she also works to include her students in activities outside of the class room – like taking them to wine tastings and teaching a cooking class. We're glad we found her.
