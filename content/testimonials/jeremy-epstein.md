Ana is thorough, patient, and above all fun and lively to have as a Spanish teacher. Her claim of "tailor-made lessons" is 100% accurate: I arrived with a level of Spanish that was already quite advanced; but she quickly managed to work out where my Spanish was lacking, and to focus her teaching in those areas. She's also creative and spontaneous: my first lesson with her was an Argentine cooking class, where she invited myself and four other students, and taught us to make empanadas. It was a blast! If you want lessons from the best Spanish teacher in Mendoza, you need look no further.
