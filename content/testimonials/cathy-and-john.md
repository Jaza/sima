Just wanted to say a big thank you for the fabulous course and wonderful lunch today.

When the dentist told us last week that John would need surgery and then need to come back in a  week to have the stitches out we were initially quite depressed. We thought we would be wasting a week doing nothing.

As it turns out the SIMA course has been a real highlight of our trip. We had a full and thoroughly enjoyable week. Both of us extended our Spanish and enjoyed the outings and activities.

Thank you for being such a patient teacher and wonderful Mendoza guide. Hope we see you in York in June and we can cook for you in return.
