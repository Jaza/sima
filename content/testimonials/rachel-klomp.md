My name is Rachel Klomp and I took private Spanish classes with Ana when I lived in Mendoza (March-November 2007). Ana is a wonderful teacher! Her classes are conducted professionally and efficiently. At the same time, her style is very relaxed and open so I never felt worried or embarrassed about making mistakes.

The first day of class we sat down together and I let her know exactly what I was hoping to learn, and she was able to cater the classes to my needs with a vast variety of helpful teaching materials. I tried taking Spanish classes at other places in the area, but Ana offered the best price for the best quality.

Another great thing about working with Ana was the scheduling. I had an extremely busy and erratic schedule while I lived there, and Ana accommodated our lessons to meet my needs in that way too.
