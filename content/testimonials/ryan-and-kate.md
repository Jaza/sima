Ana Maria is an absolutely fantastic teacher. Her knowledge of the language and its grammatical details is of course excellent, but many Spanish schools can say the same. What makes Ana Maria exceptional is that she knows how  - and clearly loves - to teach. I felt she really made an effort every day to adapt the lesson so that it matched our needs exactly and we never felt like we were wasting our time. She is also very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about her hometown and is eager to provide you with useful ideas about what to do. In short, she is doing what she was born to do and we consider ourselves very lucky to have head her as a teacher.
