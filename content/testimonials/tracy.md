She is very gracious and generous, and she is an awesome Spanish teacher! And her mother is awesome too, she made us an asado one day that was out of this world, the best asado I had in Argentina!!! Thanks for everything Ana Maria, I hope you visit me in Alaska or SF! You will always have a place to stay with me.
