A big thumbs up for S.I.M.A.! I had the pleasure of taking just three Spanish courses with Ana and this was enough to convince me to start every future trip with a language lesson like this. It was Spanish from the first word on with no opportunity to slip back into English - good practice for actual travel. I wish I'd had time for more lessons - the little bit that I learned made a big difference in trying to get around on my own and I'd like to think my efforts were appreciated by everyone I met while traveling. No tengo hambre!
