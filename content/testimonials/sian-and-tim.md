If you are looking for a good Spanish teacher in Mendoza, I can highly recommend Ana Maria. My husband and I did a 2 week beginner intensive course with her and she was brilliant, so patient and professional with us and tailored the course to what we needed and wanted to learn for our 6 months trip around Sth America. We did however do the international Spanish levels so if we want to pursue it further we have the correct paperwork with us. Our classroom was on a lovely patio under the grapevine at Ana Mariaâ€™s house. This made for a very relaxed environment and there were a lot of laughs, usually at ourselves, which according to Ana Maria is the best way to learn. Being a teacher myself it was difficult being a student again, but Ana had a huge range of different and interesting activities to keep us on track.
