Hi there

I saw this post when looking for a language school in Mendoza. I followed an earlier posted link which took me to Ana Maria Troncoso.

Can definitely recommend Ana if you´re looking to study in Mendoza, I took several hours of private classes with her and she was a brilliant patient teacher and tailored the lessons to exactly what I needed. She holds the classes at her house, and you´ll get to learn a lot about Argentinian culture too (she always offered me some traditional snacks, and Mate too which was interesting!) and she can offer you advice on good local restaurants to try/tour companies to use which I think is a big plus when you´re passing through a new place for the first time. Mendoza was a great place to visit, especially if you are interested in wine tours and seeing the Andes (which are easily accessible in a daytrip). We spent 10 days there which I think was a bit too long, so i´d say a week would be more than enough to get to know the place and practice your Spanish :)
