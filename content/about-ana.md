I am a graduate of the National University of San Juan in Language Education, and have taught for 20 years as a language instructor. As well as my experience, I have had numerous further training, including:

* an intensive Cambridge 1 month course in "Teaching Spanish as a Second or Other Language" course administered by International House in 2007
* a week-long DELE examiner's course through the Cervantes Institute of Spain in 2008
* workshops at a Language Instruction symposium in London, England, in October, 2010
* numerous other conferences, workshops and refresher courses on teaching Spanish

After working for numerous large Spanish-language schools for many years, I decided to open my own small language school in Mendoza in 2007, to better serve my students and to be able to better enjoy the experience of teaching the richness of the Hispanic language and culture to foreign students in a better setting.

### Why should I choose to study Spanish with Ani?

Because, she also organizes a language exchange in a popular bar in the city of Mendoza. She does it through Couchsurfing but she also invites locals who speak English or like to practice it and meet foreigners. It is not a class. It is an informal way to meet and chat to locals and other foreigners. It is a cool way to get information about the city, get invated to asados and parties which are always fun. All kinds of people go. Students who are studying at the university, teachers, middle age students who like to refresh their English, and young people of course.

You can contact us via the Facebook group [Intercambio de los Martes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/355353924571219/).

Are you interested in an English / Spanish language exchange? Every Tuesday we'll meet for a drink and practice 1 hour of Spanish and 1 hour of English. If you're visiting Mendoza and want to improve your Spanish, or if you speak Spanish and want to improve your English, then this is your chance to do it!

Everyone's invited. If you want to bring a friend to join us, feel free to do so, the more the merrier. It's a very casual meetup and we're going to chat, correct each other, learn about culture and exchange ideas, while practicing a language. This is completely free or charge. You only need to pay for what you eat or drink.

**Where:** Buffalo Beer Bar, Aristides Villanueva 330\
**When:** Every Tuesday\
**Time:** 9:30pm til late

### Why S.I.M.A.?

Well, The word sima, only with "c" (cima), means "the top of a mountain" (or peak, or summit) and I can compare studying and acquiring a language to climbing a very high mountain - where you not only are going to encounter some difficulties, but also, for sure, happiness. The feeling of having acquired and managed the language, and being able to commnunicate, is like getting to the top of Aconcagua. A wonderful sensation that you are about to experience.

During the "climbing", the process of acquiring the language, you may feel anxious and may suffer from altitude, or a little frustration. But don't worry! That is totally normal. It is part of the process. It means you are thinking, analysing, creating and building the new language in your mind. And that takes time, like climbing a mountain. You need to be patient and enjoy the process.

### F.A.Q. (QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS)

*1. Is the water drinkable in Argentina?*

Yes, no problem.

*2. Can I pay in American dollars in Argentina?*

Yes, as a matter of fact, people (shops, restaurants, hotels and me) will prefer that you pay in American dollars because there is a law that Argentinians can't buy dollars and that is only way to save money in Argentina.

*3. How do I greet a person that I meet for the first time?*

In Argentina, if you are a woman you kiss "everybody", men and women. If you are a man, you kiss the women and shake hands with men. You will probably see that Argentinian men kiss each other, with their friends. So if you become their friends, if you are a man you need to kiss everyone. Sometimes, if you don't do it, it is considered disrespecful. Shaking hands, for us, is only done in formal situations, at the office or university. Besides, you kiss everyone when you arrive and when you say goodbye. It is also disrespecful to leave a place without kissing everyone.

How many kisses? Well, in the big cities like Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Santa Fé and Mendoza, only one kiss; but, in the countryside, two kisses.

*4. What is considered appropriate to talk about with a person whom you have just met?*

In Argentina, you talk about personal things first, like: How old are you? What's your job? Are you single? How long have you been engaged? Where and when did you meet your boyfriend / girlfriend? What is your favourite football team? How many people are in your family? Family and personal matters are the best topics to start a conversation.

*5. Is the service in Argentina as good as in my country?*

Generally speaking, I call it "different". When you go to a restaurant, you should never go because you are hungry.
