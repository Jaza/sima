Welcome to Mendoza and congratulations! You have already bought your ticket and you are heading to Mendoza. You are part of those wise people who know that visiting a new country and not speaking the language is like missing 50% of the experience. And probably you will visit more than one country where they speak Spanish.

Studying a language is more than learning verbs and conjugations. It is watching the world through different eyes, through a different point of view. It is learning the culture, the history, the geography, the literature. Not better, not worse, just different. You may like it or not. You just need to accept it. So while in Argentina, you know what they say: "Do what the Romans do".

Studying Spanish is a process like learning any other language. You need time to assimilate this process. You need to enjoy it as well. This process is spiral. One day, you feel you know everything and you feel great. But on some other days, you learn a new tense, new congugation like the irregular verbs in the past, and you feel less great.

Do not feel frustrated. And don't even mention that to an Argentinian. Because, if you know a lilltle about this culture, history and lifestyle, well, then, you will know what frustration is. Dare youself to make mistakes. Laugh at them, and enjoy the new culture.

Be open-minded to new ideas and different lifestyles. Make friends with the locals, and practise your Spanish whenever you have the possibility. If it not now and here, when and where?

The immersion classes are the best, especially if you have little time to study. The more you speak and listen to your teacher in Spanish, the better for you. So, start reading the newspaper, listen to Spanish music, watch TV, see movies. Do the homework. And don't forget to enjoy it all the time.

Learning Spanish and travelling is an unforgetable experience that you are about to experience.

### Regarding my classes

* What most students want above all is to be able to  speak / understand spoken Spanish. This is why our aim is to get students at different levels talking.
* Our lessons make it possible for students to study key aspects of grammar and essential vocabulary in context.
* We provide contexts for new language that will engage students.
* Our lessons are targeted at students who need Spanish for travel, survival Spanish, conversational Spanish and  Spanish for specific purposes.
* The ultimate aim of most students is to be able to communicate in Spanish. We provide activities to give students a reason to communicate.
* We have designed tailor-made lessons which are suitable for students with a wide range of needs.
* We provide opportunities to make students interaction more enjoyable. We give practice in key language for situations, such as checking into a hotel, ordering a meal in a restaurant, meeting the locals.
* We give students insights into cultural awareness.
* Each lesson has clearly stated grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation aims. This keeps lessons focused, and gives students concrete learning objectives and a sense of progress.
* Our lessons include clear and memorable presentations of new structures, plenty of regular and varied practice and student- friendly reference material.

### Material for the class

You will need a pen, a notebook and a small bilingual dictionary to do your homework. I will give you a handout according to your level.

Because I have to prepare appropriate material before your classes, I have some questions for both of you, for linguistic reasons:

* What nationalities are you?
* What is your native language?
* What is your job?
* How old are you? What is your exact purpose for studying Spanish?
* What are your interests?
* What do you like to talk about?
* What is your experience in studying Spanish?

### What kind of classes would you like?

I can offer you two kind of programmes: a special programme that I call "Spanish On The Road", which includes two parts:

1. It is a mixture of theory and hard work at my house, where I am going to teach you all the grammar, vocabulary and expressions you need to survive during your trip and
2. there is a practical part where we can go out and explore the city and you can start practicing all I have taught you during the class and at the same time, I am going to be your "tourist guide" and show you the best hightlights of Mendoza. We are going to speak Spanish all the time. How does that sound?

The other option is that you choose the "Classic Programme" where I am going to teach you all you need for your trip but we are going to stay only in my house. The benefit for you of going to the activities with me is that we pre-learn the language, and you use it as part of our visit, which you would not be able to do if you did the activity by yourself. What do you think?

The teaching fees for the programme "Spanish on the Road" are the same as for the Classic classes, but the extra costs may vary according to the activities you would like to do: in general terms it is 350 to 400 pesos argentinos more for the outside businesses we visit.

Some of the activities and places we are going to visit in the programme "Spanish On The Road" are":

* **Monday:** San Martin Park and Cerro de la Gloria
* **Tuesday:** Mercado Central (local market)
* **Wednesday:** A wine tasting (where it is a guide with explanations in English and Spanish at the same time and you are going to taste and learn about the wines of a particular winery)
* **Thursday:** A beautiful terrace where there is restaurant and a view point of the city and we can enjoy a delicious breakfast.
* **Friday:** Art gallery/ Museum, cooking class.

The number of activities can vary according to the time of the year. Also I am open to do some other activities that you would like me to do with you. We just need to organise schedules. Take in account that every time we go out, like going to have breakfast, wine tastings, wineries, bars and cooking class, you will need to pay for you and me too.

So let me know which programme you would prefer. Also, contact me if you have any questions.

If you are interested in studying in Barcelona, Spain, I can recommend you this school:

[Olé Languages](https://www.olelanguages.com/) is a professional Spanish language school in Spain dedicated to teaching Spanish as a foreign language in an open, personal and enjoyable atmosphere in Barcelona.

They offer Spanish courses for all levels to competitive prices taught by dedicated, highly qualified native Spanish speakers .

The _profesores_ who teach at Olé Languages today pursue teaching as their vocation and have made a conscious decision to work in a smaller school where the atmosphere is more personal and they have more possibilities to interact with the students. Olé’s teachers hold a B.A.in Linguistics, an M.A. in Education and have extensive experience as teachers of Spanish as a foreign language.

### Levels

**Level A1**

_Beginning with DELE_

This Diploma is the first of the six learning levels proposed in the _Common European Framework of Reference for Languages_ of the Council of Europe.

Level-A1 DELE examination (DELE A1) enables students to access the Spanish-speaking world, improves their academic education and provides them with confidence to continue advancing towards the other levels.

This Diploma accredits that students will be able to use elementary language in communication situations involving immediate needs or very common everyday matters.

DELE A1 is, therefore, an internationally recognized certification tool that connects people from their first contact with Spanish and evaluates their level in Spanish from the beginning of their studies.

The DELE A1 examination consists of different tests, organized in two groups:

* Group 1 (Reading and writing skills): Reading comprehension (45 minutes) and written expression and interaction (25 minutes).
* Group 2 (Speaking skills): Listening comprehension (20 minutes) and oral expression and interaction (15 minutes).

A "passing" grade is required for each of the group of tests that a candidate sits during the same examination session.

The maximum possible score on the examination is 100 points. A minimum score of 33 is necessary for each of the two groups in order to receive an overall "passing" grade.

The final grade is either PASS or FAIL.

**Level A2**

Since November 2011 the Level-C1 DELE examination (DELE C1), which was launched in November 2010, changes and improves the format of its tests.

The DELE C1 guarantees that the progress of the student in the language has been a success, and certifies more than an advanced level of Spanish.

This diploma certifies sufficient linguistic competence to:

1. Understand a wide variety of long, quite demanding texts, as well as recognise implicit meanings in them.

* Test 1: Reading comprehension and use of language (90 minutes).
* Test 2: Listenning comprehension and use of language (50 minutes).
* Test 3: Integrated skills. Listenning comprehension and written expression and interaction (80 minutes).

**Level C2**

_Make it to the top!_

DELE C2 is the highest and most advanced of the six learning levels established in the _Common European Framework of Reference for Languages_. It certifies the level of Mastery.

The DELE C2 certifies sufficient linguistic competence to perfectly handle any kind of situation, proving a spontaneous capacity of adaptation to any context, with a great deal of semantic and grammatical precision. The language users express themselves fluently, with a high degree of specialization and complexity.

The DELE C2 examination consists of three tests:

* Test 1: Use of language, reading and listenning comprehension (90 minutes).
* Test 2: Integrated skills: Listenning and reading comprehension, and written expression and interaction (150 minutes).
