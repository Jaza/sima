$US 35 per hour for one student

Basic rate for 2 students together: $US 42 per hour for two students (works out to $US 21 for each student)

Note:

1. An "hour" is a full hour here
2. There is no "enrollment" or "evaluation" charge

### Discount rates

The payments for the discounts should be payable in dollars on the first day of classes before instruction (please make an arrangement if you want to pay in other currency).

It is also a good idea to obtain foreign currency for the course and other activities before coming to Argentina.

**Note:** In every course, there is a folder with copies to work according to each level (each level normally takes approximately 20 hours each, depending on the student). Every folder is tailor-made. That costs an extra $US 30, for photocopy costs only.
