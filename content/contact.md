### Directions for new students

Most of my classes are at my house, where I have a lot of equipment and material. It has a quiet patio under a grape arbour, and tea/coffee is free :)

It is in the 6th section of the Mendoza City, "Capital".

It would be best to take a taxi the first time, although you could take the "Parque" Trolley, on 9 de Julio Street, Colon Street or Aristides Villanueva Street, and take the trolley to my street, Paraná, 3 blocks from where I live, walk east from the stop at the corner of Boulounge Sur Mer.

The trolley stop is the 5th one past the big Park Gates of the immense Parque San Martin. The trip is pleasant.

There IS a bus stop from here that will take you the micro-centro, a half block from my house, but it is too complicated to explain how you can get here by bus. You can return by bus easily though.

There is a city bus that goes to a block and a half to my place that leaves directly from inside the terminal, called number 91 (Line 7) that says "Bo San Martin"on the window sign. You  can catch it every 15 to 20 minutes from 6 am to 1 pm from between platforms 40 to 44 right in the bus terminal. Ask the bus driver to let you out at the corner of Paso de Los Andes and Suipacha, then walk one block north on Paso and one block east on Paraná.

The buses and trolleys all cost 6 pesos with a card only,  You have buy a rechargeable card at some kioskos for 10 pesos, precharge and use on the trolley/bus machine.

My address is *Calle Paraná 628*, halfway between ("entre") Paso de Los Andes and Calle Granaderos, Capital. If you write that down and give it to the taxi driver, he will take you here. It will probably cost between 25 and 35 pesos, depending on the traffic.
