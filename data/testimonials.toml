  content = '''Ana Maria is an absolutely fantastic teacher. Her knowledge of the language and its grammatical details is of course excellent, but many Spanish schools can say the same. What makes Ana Maria exceptional is that she knows how  - and clearly loves - to teach. I felt she really made an effort every day to adapt the lesson so that it matched our needs exactly and we never felt like we were wasting our time. She is also very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about her hometown and is eager to provide you with useful ideas about what to do. In short, she is doing what she was born to do and we consider ourselves very lucky to have head her as a teacher.

  content = '''Ana's class was terrific.  My girlfriend and I only knew a few Spanish words before taking her class, and by the end we felt comfortable navigating quite a broad range of practical situations in Spanish. Ana's teaching style is natural, clear, and fun. One of the best aspects of taking Ana's class was that her lesson's were always extremely useful, because she was always took great care to focus on subjects and scenarios that we were interested in learning about. I'd definitely recommend her classes to anyone who wishes to learn Spanish in a comfortable environment.

  content = '''I spent two weeks receiving private lessons with Ani in February 2012. My classes were a combination of theory and her contemporary Spanish-On-The-Road Program. I wanted very specific lessons that would enable me to both prepare for my month of volunteering as an occupational therapist in an orphanage in Bolivia, as well as to experience the local delights of Mendoza.

Ani is an exceptional teacher and not only did she help me to learn vocabulary specific to my volunteer project but she  also has a very strong understanding of Latin American culture and incorporated the importance of this in our lessons.

She will also cater your Spanish on the road to meet your interests, which for me was epitomized in our day trip to the thermal pools where we practiced conversational spanish over gourmet lunch and local wine, before having our formal lessons beside the thermal pools and surrounded by the Andean Mountains.

She was also able to incorporate my love for empanadas into a learning experience as my final lesson was an empanada cooking class. Ani is always professional and prepared and has a huge repertoire of learning materials that are very interactive (this for me was a huge bonus as I studied in other Latin American countries that were purely pen and paper activities).

So, if you are looking for a Spanish teacher who will enable you to meet very specific needs and as an added bonus lives in one of the most enchanting parts of Argentina then look no further because Ana Maria Troncosco is for you.
